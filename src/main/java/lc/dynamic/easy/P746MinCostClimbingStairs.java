 *         On a staircase, the i-th step has some non-negative cost cost[i] assigned (0 indexed).
 * 
 *         Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You need to find minimum
 *         cost to reach the top of the floor, and you can either start from the step with index 0,
 *         or the step with index 1.
